        Full-stack refers to a group of programming languages
        and tools a developer learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development of a website.
        As a full-stack developer,you'll  have to learn multiple languages related to web development
        along with a few concepts of web design.
        Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS).
        The Term Back-end web development  usually refers to what happens ‘behind the scenes’: servers, databases, etc. The back end is the place we don’t see as users.Back end server code can be written using JavaScript. However, it can be also written using many other languages, such as Ruby, Java, or Python.
