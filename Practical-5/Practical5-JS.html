        JavaScript is a simple and easy-to-learn programming language as
        compared to other languages such as C++, Ruby, and Python. It is a
        high-level, interpreted language that can easily be embedded with
        languages like HTML. It was developed by Netscape Communications
        Corporation, Mozilla Foundation, and ECMA International. JavaScript is
        commonly used for creating web pages. It allows us to add dynamic
        behavior to the webpage and add special effects to the webpage. On
        websites, it is mainly used for validation purposes. JavaScript helps us
        to execute complex actions and also enables the interaction of websites
        with visitors.
